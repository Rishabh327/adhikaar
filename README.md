# Adhikaar

Adhikaar is an AI-powered civic information assistant that helps Indian students discover government scholarships they are eligible for and guides them through eligibility criteria, required documents, and deadlines. It improves access to public resources with a focus on inclusion and accessibility for first-generation and low–literacy users.

## 📌 What's in this Repo

This repository contains:
- `requirements.md` — Functional and non-functional requirements generated via Kiro
- `design.md` — System design and architecture generated via Kiro

These documents outline the product vision, user stories, features, and high-level architecture of the Adhikaar application.

## 🛠️ Scope Note

This specification describes a scalable and extensible solution. The hackathon MVP focuses on:
- A rule-based eligibility engine
- Static scholarship dataset
- Simple web interface
- AI reasoning for explanations

The system does **not** automate submissions or integrate with official APIs at this stage.

## 🧠 Challenge Mapped

**Challenge:** AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact  
**Problem:** Students miss out on eligible government scholarships due to awareness, language, and process barriers.
